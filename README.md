# Nextjs + TypeScript Custom Setup Script

`setup.sh` is a shell script used to add my usual dependencies and dev dependencies.

## Installation and Execution

1. copy `setup.sh` into the repo you just created with Next + TS
1. make the file executable by running `chmod +x setup.sh`
1. execute the setup `./setup.sh`
